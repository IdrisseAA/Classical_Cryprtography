# Classical_Cryprtography
A program that can help you to encrypt a text by choosing your method. 

I have written in 2016 when I was doing my Bachelor's degree.

Write the plaintext in the indicated place,  then click on the cipher button so the ciphertext will appear in the indicated place.

You can save your ciphertext after the end of the encryption process.

Each encryption method has its plaintext and cipher place, its cipher, and its save button.   

All of the methods have been written from scratch.
